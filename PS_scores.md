# Semi-nonymized problem set score table for current students
## Fall 2025
For students, the last five digits of your student IDs were used. For non-students, or those whose IDs I don't know, the first few letters in your names were used. Let me know if you cannot identify your score.

| Student ID / Code Name  | PS1 | PS2 | PS3 | PS4 | PS5 | PS6 |
