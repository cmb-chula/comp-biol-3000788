# Welcome to comp-biol-3000788
This is the repository for the learning materials from the **3000788: Introduction to Computational Molecular Biology** course taught by our group at the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand.

## Past years' materials
**English video contents recorded in Fall 2022** can be found [here](https://github.com/cmb-chula/comp-biol-3000788/blob/main/EN_videos.md).

**Thai video contents recorded in Fall 2023** can be found [here](https://github.com/cmb-chula/comp-biol-3000788/blob/main/TH_videos.md).

All slides and handouts are provided in English.

Here is a [guide](https://github.com/cmb-chula/comp-biol-3000788/blob/main/Video_study_guide.xlsx) of the keywords and key concepts to look out for while watching the videos.

## Announcements
Announcements and accumulated interesting discussions will be posted in the *Discussion*. Please check them for more contents.
