# Welcome to comp-biol-3000788
This is the repository for the learning materials from the **3000788: Introduction to Computational Molecular Biology** course taught by our group at the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand.

Current contents are from Fall 2023 (ongoing). The slides and problem sets are all in English.

Recorded lecture videos are hosted on Echo360.

**For past years' videos**, please visit the [Courses page](http://cmb.md.chula.ac.th/courses.html) of our website.
* The English version was recorded in Fall 2022.
* The Thai version was recorded in Fall 2020 and is currently being updated.

## What can you find here?
1. Latest lecture slides in PDF format
2. Compiled list of URLs for recorded videos (See below)
3. Problem sets and other assignments
4. Data and scripts for in-class demos
5. Python notebooks for the programming sessions
